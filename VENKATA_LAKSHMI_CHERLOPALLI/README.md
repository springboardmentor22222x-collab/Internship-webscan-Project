# My First Project
This project is a web scanner utility developed for demonstration purposes.
## Usage

To run the WebScanPro scanner against a target application, use the following command structure. Note that the target URL must be provided using the `-u` or `--url` argument.

The target application (e.g., OWASP Juice Shop) must be running and accessible at the specified URL.

```bash
python scanner.py --url [TARGET_URL]
